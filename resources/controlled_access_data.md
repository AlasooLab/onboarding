# Best practices for working with controlled access human genetic data

Human genetic data cannot be anonymised, because even a small number of genetic variants can uniquely indentify an individual. Thus, to protect the privacy of research participants, we need to keep genetic data secure at all times. Remember: privacy is a non-renewable resource, it cannot be recovered once it has been lost. This pages outlines for some basic best practices for working with sensitive human genetic data.

1. **Individual-level data should always stay at the university servers and should never be copied to your personal computer or anywhere else outside the univeristy servers.** This also means no Google Drive, Dropbox or GitHub.
2. **Only people who are currently authorized to work with the dataset should be able to access it.** In practice, this means that each dataset has its own user group and only authorised users should be members of that group. When working alone on a dataset, you should do it in your home folder and make sure that nobody else is allowed to access your home folder (e.g. the permissions of your home folder should be *drwx------*). **Never change the permissions of your home folder to share data with other users!** If multiple people need to work on the same dataset, then they should be part of the same user group and they should do it in a project-specific folder (ask Kaur to set it up).
